"Hello All this is a simple project to make an ambient lighting system for computers.
The Idea behind the project is to create a system which can change the led lights attached to it,
according to the different inputs (Audio, Screen Ambience, Random, & Selectable Modes).
The project uses visual studio for all the windows based coding, along with PlatformIO integration for
the IOT part."



Setting up the project ->

Please foollow along to setup the project at your end.

Prerequisites ->

[Hardware]
1. A computer
2. An Arduino
3. HC05 Bluetooth Module
4. Some cables to connect all the stuff up.
5. And a bluetooth adaptor for the pc [i.e. if you motherboard do not have built in bluetooth]
6. And a coil of RGB LEDs.

***NOTE : [Follow the connection isntructions to connect the Board with the HC05 and the ligts]


[Software]
1. Visual studio (Installed)
2. Arudino IDE (Installed) [This is to install the required drivers for the IOT board you are using.]
3. PlatformIO Core/CLI (Installed)


Steps ->

***NOTE : [Before starting with loading up the project in visual studio, you should open up Ardunio IDE and update
the drivers for the board you are using. When you open up the Arduino IDE (While keeping the board
plugged in to the USB), Arduino IDE will automatically detect the attached board and download the related \
drivers. Id this is not the case for you, then you can use 'tools->boards->board manager' to install the
latest drivers for the board you are using.]


1. Repo the project at your end.
2. Open up the lidcap.sln solution in visual studio.
3. Build the project. [Building the project should automatically upload the firmware to your board]
